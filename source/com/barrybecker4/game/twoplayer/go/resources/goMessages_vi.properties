GO_OVERVIEW = Go is a game with simple rules, but can take a lifetime to master.\n Stones are placed on the board one at a time and cannot be moved.\n There are 4 simple rules are:\n   1) When a group of stones is completely surrounded they are captured.\n     Each capture counts as 1 point at the end.\n   2) Every empty space completely surrounded by a group of stones of one\n     color counts as a point.\n \
    3) The board cannot look like it did at any time in the past (rule of ko)\n   4) When the 2 players have passed in succession, the game is over.
