BLOCKADE_COMMENTS = A Blockade application by Barry Becker
BLOCKADE_OVERVIEW = Blockade is a relatively new game created by Lakeside.\n Each player starts with two pawns on designated spaces near their side of the board.\n They each have (typically) ten blue walls and ten green walls, which fit in the slots\n between the grid squares and are two squares wide. A player's turn consists\n of moving his pawn two spaces and then placing a wall anywhere on the grid.\n The object is to get one of your pawns around the obstacles being set by your \n opponent and onto one of his or her starting spaces.\n It is illegal to block a pawn completely from being able to reach either goal.
CANT_OVERLAP_WALLS = You cannot overlap one wall with another
MUST_HAVE_ONE_PATH = You cannot place a wall there because it prevents one or more of the pawns from reaching an opponent home base.
