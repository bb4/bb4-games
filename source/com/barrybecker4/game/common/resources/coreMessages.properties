NEGAMAX_SEARCH = NegaMax Search
NEGAMAX_SEARCH_TIP = Identical to minimax but the code is simpler
NEGASCOUT_SEARCH = Nega-Scout Search
NEGASCOUT_SEARCH_TIP = A bit like negamax, but small search windows are used to see if we can get a good result without a broader window.
NEGASCOUT_W_MEMORY_SEARCH = Nega-Scout Search (with memory)
NEGASCOUT_W_MEMORY_SEARCH_TIP = Version of negascout that uses a transposition table to remember moves that have already been searched.

MTD_NEGAMAX_SEARCH = Memory enhanced Test Driver Search (uses nega-max with memory).
MTD_NEGAMAX_SEARCH_TIP = Memory enhanced test drive that calls out to nega-max.
UCT_SEARCH = Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) Search
UCT_SEARCH_TIP = UCT is quite different that the others. It relies on a monte carlo method to adaptively expand search.
MOVES_TO_LOOKAHEAD = Moves to look ahead (1 easy - 8 difficult and slow):
MOVES_TO_LOOKAHEAD_TIP = This controls how well the computer will play. If quiescence is on, then the look ahead may be greater thatn this for selected paths.
PERCENTAGE_AT_PLY = Percentage of best moves to consider at each ply (5-100):
PERCENTAGE_AT_PLY_TIP = The percentage of moves to consider at each ply. \nThese are the top moves using static evaluation. \nIf small percentage then the game will run faster.
UPPER_BOUND = The upper bound for the size of the game tree is :
USE_PRUNING = Use alpha beta pruning
USE_PRUNING_TIP = this will eliminate many branches in the game tree - improving performance significantly
PERCENT_LESS_THAN_BEST_THRESH = Limit to moves greater than this percent less than the best
PERCENT_LESS_THAN_BEST_THRESH_TIP = Only moves that are greater than this percent lest than the score of the best move in the list will be considered.
USE_QUIESCENCE = Use quiescence
USE_QUIESCENCE_TIP = Quiescence means we will pursue certain paths further until we can confirm that they are stable (i.e. quiet).
MAX_NUM_SIMULATIONS = Maximum number of simulations
MAX_NUM_SIMULATIONS_TIP = Runs random simulations to converge on optimal next move.
RANDOM_LOOK_AHEAD = Number of random moves when playing random game
RANDOM_LOOK_AHEAD_TIP = The number of semi-random moves to play from the starting state in a simulated random game. We choose the moves randomly from a set of good moves.
EXPLORE_EXPLOIT_RATIO = Ratio of exploration to exploitation
EXPLORE_EXPLOIT_RATIO_TIP = The larger this number is the more exploration the search does; smaller will do more exploitation of known good moves; balanced around 1.0.
MIN_BEST_MOVES = Minimum best moves to consider
MIN_BEST_MOVES_TIP = Don't consider fewer than this many of the best moves when searching for the next move
DEBUG_OPTIONS = Debugging Options
DEBUG_LEVEL = Debug Level (0-4)   :
DEBUG_LEVEL_TIP = 0=no debug info; 1= visual debug only; 2= more assertions and print minimal debug info; 3= significant printing (slows performance)
SEND_LOG_OUTPUT = Send the log output to
CONSOLE = the console
SEPARATE_WINDOW = a separate window
THIS_FILE = this file:
SHOW_PROFILE_STATS = Show Profile statistics
SHOW_PROFILE_STATS_TIP = Prints some timing information to the console after each computer generated move
SHOW_GAME_TREE = Show Game Tree
SHOW_GAME_TREE_TIP = Shows a separate window to represent the game tree for exploration and deeper understanding of the minimax algorithm
SHOW_ANIMATION = Show animation of computer processing
SHOW_ANIMATION_TIP = Cycles through all the moves that the computer considers while trying to decide where to move next (slows performance)
